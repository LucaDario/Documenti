The following document will explain how to use **Monolith - An interactive bubble provider**, the stand-alone 
[Atmosphere.js](https://atmospherejs.com/)-hosted package developed by [NPE Developers](https://github.com/NPE-Developers).

The purpose of Monolith is to provide an SDK which will let the developer that uses it create one of the default bubble 
types that are present inside it, or extends them to create new kinds of bubble, that will be shown inside a 
[Rocket.chat](https://rocket.chat/) room as interactive messages.
