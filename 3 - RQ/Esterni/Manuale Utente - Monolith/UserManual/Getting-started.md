To install Monolith you will need the following things:
* an internet connection;
* the knowledge on how to setup a [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) project.

Once you got both of the two, the only things that are needed in order to start using Monolith inside your Meteor project, is to go inside the root folder of your project, and type the following shell commands:
```
> meteor install monolith
> meteor reset
> meteor npm install
> meteor run
```
**Note**. This procedure will erase all the temporary files that might have been created during previous project
runs (such as databases, logs, etc.), but it will ensure that Monolith is properly installed.
