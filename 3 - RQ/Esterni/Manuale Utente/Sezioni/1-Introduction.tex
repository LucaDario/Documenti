\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose of the document}
The purpose of this document is supplying a detailed guide to the user of either \progettoShort, the SDK created by the \gruppo\ group, or \app, the demo application that has been created by the same group to show some of the possible uses of the already mentioned \termine{SDK}. \\
As the group has realized two different products, this document is intended for two different user's types:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The first type of user is the developer which will use \progettoShort\ inside his \termine{Meteor.js} project in order to integrate part of its feature into it;
	\item The second type of user is the application's user, which will use the demo application as-it-is.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Purpose of the product}
This project is divided in two parts with different purposes. \\
The first part is an \termine{SDK}, called \progettoShort, which allows a developer to create interactive bubbles easily which have to be able to work inside the \termine{Rocket.chat} environment. \\
The second part is a demo application developed using the above mentioned \progettoShort\ and which uses the provided bubbles. Our application is called \app and allows you to create an interactive and sharable to-do or shopping list.

\subsection{Glossary}
To avoid misunderstandings with technical terms of this document, words that require a detailed explanation will be marked with a \textit{G} and then the word will be inserted in the respective section of the glossary.
